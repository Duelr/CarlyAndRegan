# Things I Admire About You And Some Promises

```
You smile like a sunflower
So I promise to water your roots,
By trying to make you laugh a little, every day

You nourish my soul with your wholesomeness
So I promise to cook for you often,
So you get hangry on fewer days

You are a good listener
So I promise to think about what I say
Before I put my foot in my mouth :)

You are patient while I struggle to handle my worries and fears
So I promise to practice mindfulness
And let go of the things that I can't control

You constantly challenge me to be better
So I promise to never let my ideals waiver
Even in when life gets hard

You are magical like a unicorn
So I promise to give you the space
And attention you need to thrive

You are deeply caring about the things you do
So I promise to listen, carefully, to all your words
When I hear them coming from your heart

You are generous like the Earth that gave us life
So I promise to worship your love
In sickness and in health, always forever
