# Carly's Vows


If I had known 4 years ago that the goofball who held my hand and quoted Sleepless in Seattle to me on our first date would be the person I am standing before two today with two dogs, a mortgage, and years of super fun memories, it wouldn't have surprised me, even then.

Regan, loving you is and has always been so easy to do. I feel so incredibly lucky today and every day to spend my time with you. You light up rooms and my life with your curiousity, easy going nature, and your boundless love of life and everyone around you. You are so thoughtful in your intentions and joyful in your pace through this life. When things get tough you always fight for our relationship above your (or my own) ego, and you show me every day what it looks like to show up and make the decision to love someone and be a good partner to them. From the first day I've known you, you've accepted me so completely and unconditionally, and loved me so purely. I feel that love and acceptance so unwaveringly, and for that I am so grateful to you. 

Now, the contractual obligations:
I promise to always give you the rest of my food that I can't finish.
I promise to be a cool frisbee wife at your tournaments.
I promise to try hard at not leaving every bag of food in the kitchen opened after using it. 
I promise to drink more water 
I promise to try to be less stubborn, even though it is a sign of determination and therefore actually a beneficial personality trait. 
I promise to listen to and trust your instincts too. 
I promise to always come back and talk about things.
I promise to be there for you and help you whenever you need me 
I promise to support and encourage your many ideas, passions, and goals. 
I promise to walk this path with you, not in front of you and not behind you.
I promise I will always be your friend. 
Above all, I promise tp cherish the little things with you, because every day with you is filled with a million tiny joys, and I wouldn't trade any of them for the world. 

I love you.
